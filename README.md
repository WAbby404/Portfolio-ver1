# Portfolio Site - WAbby404.github.io
## This is first verion of my portfolio. This project is intended to give myself a platform to post my projects, share my information, and make myself available for future employers and collaborators.

My Portfolio site was one of the earliest projects I've worked on while practicing Javascript, HTML & CSS. This site will be constantly updated with projects and new information about what I've been working on, and what technologies I am currently practicing. My next project coming soon is a Build-A-Quiz app!
